This is a simple number guessing game with a graphical user interface (GUI) developed using PyQt6. Players are prompted to enter a number within a specified range, and the program generates a random number for comparison.The game script was written in python and the UI was designed using QT designer.

## Features

- Graphical User Interface (GUI) for an interactive user experience.
- Customizable range for number guessing.
- Random number generation for each round.
- Feedback on whether the guessed number is incorrect or correct.

## Requirements

- Python 3.
- PyQt6 library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/El-charis/python-final-project.git
    cd number-guessing-game
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install PyQt6
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python number_guessing_game.py
    ```

2. Follow the on-screen instructions to enter a number within the specified range.

3. Receive feedback on whether the guessed number is correct or Incorrect.

4. Enjoy playing the game!

## Configuration

You can customize the game by modifying the following parameters in the script:

- **Number Range**: Adjust the minimum and maximum values for the number range.


## Code Structure

The code is structured as follows:

- `number_guessing_game.py`: Main python script containing the game logic implementation.
- `NumGuessing.ui`:contains the UI Implementation
- `README.md`: Documentation file.

## possible Improvements in future

Here are some possible improvements that could be considered for future enhancements of the number guessing game project:

Scoring System:
Implement a scoring system to track users' performance and encourage multiple rounds of play.
Assign points based on correct guesses and display a score summary at the end.

Difficulty Levels:
Introduce different difficulty levels with varying ranges or additional challenges for advanced players.
Provide users with the option to choose their preferred difficulty level.

User Profiles:
Implement user profiles to allow multiple users to track their individual progress and achievements.
Store user profiles and scores for a personalized gaming experience.

Visual Enhancements:
Improve the visual aesthetics of the GUI with more appealing graphics, animations, or themes.
Consider adding sound effects to enhance the gaming atmosphere.

Game Statistics:
Include a statistics section displaying overall game statistics, such as the number of games played, average score, and success rate.

Multiplayer Mode:
Introduce a multiplayer mode, allowing users to compete against each other or collaborate in guessing numbers.
Tutorial Section:

Create a tutorial section or interactive guide to help new users understand the game rules and features.

Localization:
Add support for multiple languages to make the game accessible to a broader audience.

Mobile Compatibility:
Optimize the GUI for mobile devices, enabling users to enjoy the game on smartphones and tablets.

Bug Fixes and Refactoring:
Conduct thorough testing to identify and fix any potential bugs or issues.
Consider refactoring the code for better maintainability and scalability.
These improvements can enhance the overall user experience, add depth to the gameplay, and make the application more versatile for a wider audience.
